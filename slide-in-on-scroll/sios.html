				WASHINGTON, N.C. — As the flat-bottomed fishing boat crept into a swirling river that had once been Summer Haven Lane, Tray Tillman scanned the brown floodwaters and half-submerged houses in search of somebody to save.
				</p>
				<p>
				“Today it’s been women and kids,” Mr. Tillman said.
				</p>
				<p>
				Mr. Tillman, 26, a construction foreman, was part of a makeshift rescue flotilla that has plucked hundreds of stranded people from attics, second-floor bedrooms, church vestibules and crumbling decks as relentless, record-setting rains from Tropical Storm Florence flood rivers across the Carolinas and send torrents of water through downtowns miles away from the coast.
				</p>
				<p>
				Inland flooding is perhaps the biggest continuing danger as Florence trudges through the Carolinas, and an improvised network of volunteers, some helping from as far away as Africa, has sprung up to locate and rescue people who did not evacuate. Harnett County, N.C., which is in the path of a river that was expected to crest overnight at 17 feet above flood stage, was one of many jurisdictions that ordered new evacuations. At least six deaths were confirmed.
				</p>
				<p>
				“They’re used to flooding, but nothing like this,” said Dan DiRenzo, who steered the boats with New Jersey Task Force One Urban Search and Rescue, one of the teams deployed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia.
				</p>

				FEMA said it had more than 1,000 workers in the Carolinas, and the Coast Guard said it had ships and search-and-rescue crews at the ready. Tennessee sent firefighters and swift-water rescue specialists, and Maryland said it would send its helicopter aquatic rescue team, including two Blackhawk helicopters, on Sunday. A team of specialists in urban search-and-rescue and medical care left with boats to North Carolina from New York City, and another team left from Nevada.

				There are scores of highly trained rescuers deployed by FEMA. There are hundreds of local sheriff’s deputies and firefighters trundling through neighborhoods in their tallest trucks. There are volunteers with unofficial rescue groups such as the Cajun Navy, and monitors as far away as Nigeria searching for calls for help and posting people’s locations on crowdsourced rescue databases.
				</p>
				<p>
				Then there is Mr. Tillman: a guy with a boat.
				</p>
				<p>
				A former soldier, he was just a local resident who wanted to help. On Friday, he drove around Washington, N.C., with a metal skiff lashed to the top of his minivan, responding to pleas posted online for help. When a rescue partner who had been working with him got tired, Mr. Tillman went out alone. When he broke his outboard propeller on a piece of wood, he hunted down a replacement.
				</p>
				<p>
				On Friday alone, more than 385 people were rescued from the city of New Bern, about 40 miles to the south. Dozens more were rescued from homes in Washington, up and down the Pamlico River.
				</p>
				<p>
				.......
				</p>
				<p>
				They tried to get their bearings. Was that a street or a creek? What was the difference anymore?
				</p>
				<p>
				“Nobody step out of the boat at anytime,” said Mr. O’Neal, whose day job is as a safety specialist. “We don’t know what’s in there.”
				</p>
				<p>
				Was this Summer Haven Lane? They couldn’t see any signs.
				</p>
				<p>
				“Where we going right now?” Mr. Tillman asked.
				</p>
				<p>
				They steered around mailboxes, branches, pulverized decking and other debris that could blow out the propeller. When the water got too shallow and the boat scraped bottom, the men hopped out and waded, grabbing pieces of fence post and siding to sound the depth of the water in front of them.
